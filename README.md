# Income and Happiness: An Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Well-Being

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between national average income and happiness scores across countries. The objective is to explore whether wealthier nations tend to report higher levels of happiness and to visualize trends within middle- and high-income countries.

The analysis focuses on countries with an average income above $10,000 to better understand patterns among economically stable nations.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

* Country name
* Average income
* Happiness score

These variables allow us to investigate the relationship between economic conditions and reported well-being.

---

## Project Workflow

1. Load dataset using Pandas
2. Sort countries by average income
3. Filter countries with income greater than $10,000
4. Create a scatter plot of income vs happiness score
5. Highlight the top three happiest countries

---

## Tools and Libraries

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

---

## Key Insights

The scatter plot reveals a positive relationship between income and happiness among higher-income countries. However, the results highlight that income alone does not fully explain variations in happiness.

This reinforces the idea that well-being is influenced by multiple social and economic factors beyond income.

## Future Improvements

* Add regression analysis to quantify correlation
* Include more socioeconomic indicators
* Expand visualization with interactive plots
* Analyze lower-income countries for comparison
